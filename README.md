# Hey, I'm Peter 👋

I'm a designer with a focus on high-performance residential architecture. I have spent the last several years working in the Architectural field, and I'm particularly interested in how sustainable design and technology can transform the way we live.

As a Certified Passive House Designer, I’m passionate about applying rigorous energy-efficiency standards to residential contexts to create homes that are both beautiful and functional.

## A few things I am interested in

* **Sustainable Architecture:** Exploring Passive House principles and energy-efficient building envelopes.
* **Design & Technology:** Using tools like Grasshopper, Rhino, Blender and web development to bridge the gap between technical specs and visual storytelling.

* **Problem Solving:** Building functional tools, like my recent project developing a unit conversion app.
* **The Arts:** Exploring the intersection of architecture and free-form physical media.

## Creative Work & Projects

* **Portraiture:** Focusing on capturing character and depth through detailed studies of the human form.
* **Acrylics:** Experimenting with texture and layering 
* **Aerosol Painting:** Scaling up my work through street-art techniques, focusing on the interplay of color and movement on a larger canvas.
* **Architecture:** Five years of experience working on large-scale projects at Stantec, now focusing on residential Passive House design.

## Outside of work

Based in Vancouver, BC. When I’m not designing or painting, I’m digging in the crates at a record store, mountain biking, hiking and running.
